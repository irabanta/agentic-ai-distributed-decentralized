# Distributed Decentralized Agentic AI for Fintech Loan Applications

This project is a Python-based, distributed, decentralized agentic AI system designed for the end-to-end loan application and approval process in Fintech. It leverages standard protocols such as **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**, **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, and **AP2 (Agent Protocol 2)** to ensure interoperability, security, and scalability.

## Key Features
- **Distributed & Decentralized**: Agents operate across multiple nodes, ensuring resilience and no single point of failure.
- **Agentic AI**: Each agent can reason, communicate, and act autonomously within the loan process.
- **Protocol-Driven**: Adheres to A2A, MCP, and AP2 standards for secure, interoperable agent communication.
- **Fintech Use Case**: Focused on automating and optimizing the loan application, evaluation, and approval workflow.
- **Open for Contributions**: Designed as a collaborative project for engineering students and the open-source community.

## Use Case Overview
- **Loan Application Submission**
- **Credit Scoring & Risk Assessment**
- **Document Verification**
- **Approval/Denial Decisioning**
- **Notifications & Audit Trail**

## Technologies & Standards
- **Python 3.x**
- **A2A, MCP, AP2 Protocols**
- **Distributed Systems & Messaging**
- **Security & Privacy Best Practices**

## Getting Started
